# MGBlog
Modern Golang Blog

**Work-In-Progress**

Status:
Backend is nearing sufficient completion for me to start working on the front-end

# TODO (An incomplete list):
Backend
- ~~Change post slugs to include year and month (Ex. blog.com/2020/02/post-title)~~
- ~~Add asset image url for both header and preview for posts~~
- ~~Add search by tags~~

Frontend
- Post component
- Sidebar component
- Admin login
- Admin dashboard
- Etc. (lots to do here)

*Later down the line*
- Comment support?
- Search by month/year
