# Bear Post
A Modern Blog Engine.

Uses Go for the backend and React for the frontend.

**Work-In-Progress**

Status:
Looking into Higher Order Components

## TODO (An incomplete list):
### Backend
- ~~Change post slugs to include year and month (Ex. blog.com/2020/02/post-title)~~
- ~~Add asset image url for both header and preview for posts~~
- ~~Add search by tags~~
- ~~Add support for hidden posts~~

### Frontend
- Post component (Working on styling)
- Search component
- Admin login
- Admin dashboard
- Etc. (lots to do here)

*Later down the line*
- Comment support? (Very low-priority)
- Search by month/year (Need to add backend route)
- Add state persistence (Low-priority)
